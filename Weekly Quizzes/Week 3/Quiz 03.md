Question 02
-----------  
Given a sequence database, as shown in Table 4, and the support threshold min-sup = 3, use Generalized Sequential Patterns (GSP) to find the frequent sequential patterns. After scanning the database once, how many length-2 candidate sequences will be generated after Apriori pruning? How many length-2 candidate sequences will be generated if not using Apriori pruning?

Question 03
-----------  
Given a sequence database, as shown in Table 8, and support threshold min-sup = 4, use Generalized Sequential Patterns (GSP) to find the frequent sequential patterns. What is the minimum number of times we need to scan the database in order to find all the frequent sequential patterns?
