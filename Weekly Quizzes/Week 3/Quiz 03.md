Question 02
-----------  
Given a sequence database, as shown in Table 5, and support threshold min-sup = 4, use Generalized Sequential Patterns (GSP) to find the frequent sequential patterns. After scanning the database once, how many length-2 candidate sequences will be generated after Apriori pruning? How many length-2 candidate sequences will be generated if not using Apriori pruning?

Question 03
-----------  
Given a sequence database, as shown in Table 8, and support threshold min-sup = 4, use Generalized Sequential Patterns (GSP) to find the frequent sequential patterns. What is the minimum number of times we need to scan the database in order to find all the frequent sequential patterns?

Question 06
-----------  
In our database, we have the following three graphs:  
![Fig 11](https://github.com/UtkarshPathrabe/Pattern-Discovery-In-Data-Mining/blob/master/Weekly%20Quizzes/Week%203/Fig11.png "Fig 11")  
If we set the support threshold min-sup = 3, which of the following sequences is NOT a frequent graph pattern?

Question 07
-----------  
When we use the Apiori-based approach to find the frequent graph pattern for a candidate graph, we need to check all of its subgraphs. Given the following graph, how many distinct subgraphs with seven vertices are there?

Question 09
-----------  
Suppose we have learned two ranked rules as follows (the default is Type 2):  
* `{"ipad", "iphone"}` -> Type 1  
* `{"kindle", "iphone"}` -> Type 2  
* `{"ipad"}` -> Type 1  

For the people who have `{"kindle", "iphone"}`, which type will they be classified as by CBA algorithm?  

#### Answer  
Type 2
