Question
--------  
Suppose we have the transaction history of Apple(A) and Banana(B) from a grocery store, as shown in the table with the expected number in parenthesis.  
Which of the following statements is correct?  
|   |        A |         !A |
|:-:|:--------:|:----------:|
| B |  `50(57)`|`200(192)`  |
|!B |`750(742)`|`2500(2507)`|  

### Answer  
Lift < 1; Psi square > 0;  

### Explanation  
Since the number of transactions (50) with both Apple and Banana is smaller than the expected number (57), items Apple and Banana are negatively correlated, thus Lift < 1; Psi square > 0; as long that the items of interest are correlated.
