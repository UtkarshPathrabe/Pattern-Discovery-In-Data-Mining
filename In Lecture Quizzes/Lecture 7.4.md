Question
--------  
|SID|    <b>Sequence</b>             |
|:-:|:------------------------------:|
| 10|         `<a(abc)(ac)d(cf)>`    |
| 20|      `<(ad)c(bc)(ae)>`         |
| 30|       `<(ef)(ab)(df)cb>`       |
| 40|          `<eg(af)cbc>`         |  
Table 1: Transactions from a database.  
For the given sequence database, which of the following belongs to the <f>-projected database?  
* `<c_>`  
* `<(ab)(df)cb>`  
* `<cb>`  
* `<(_a)cbc>`  

### Answer  
`<(ab)(df)cb>`  

### Explanation  
All the sequences in the database will be represented as follows in the <f>-projected database.  
* SID-10: `<>`  
* SID-20: `<>`  
* SID-30: `<(ab)(df)cb>`  
* SID-40: `<cbc>`  

By simple comparison, we can see that B belongs to the <f>-projected database.
