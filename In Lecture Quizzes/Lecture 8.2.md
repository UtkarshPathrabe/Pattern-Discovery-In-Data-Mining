Quiz  
====  

If we are using the Apriori-based approach, when we find a candidate of k edges in the previous round (i.e., (k-1) edges), AT MOST how many of its subgraphs could we find that are also frequent?  
* k  
* k - 1  
* k / 2  
* 1  

### Answer  
k  

### Explanation  
There are at most k subgraphs of this k-edge candidate (by removing an edge, you can ignore whether it is connected or not).
